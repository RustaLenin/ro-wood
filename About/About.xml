        &lt;size=24&gt;HSK idea&lt;/size&gt;
        The idea to create this project, appeared after using other modpacks, in which I didn't like a game balance. Some of its mods greatly simplify the gameplay, making it soon not interesting. The main idea of the Rimworld to overcome difficulties that you'll encounter when landing on the planet... The more problems you will have, the more interesting it will be your story... You have a goal, a heavy goal - to survive. It make Rimworld worth replaying again and again... Main focus based on the growing complexity of the gameplay. Trying to achieve greater..Maximally immerse the player into gameplay and stay there for a long time. More than 100 research are waiting. When you start playing, you immediately understand everything... Campfire welcomes you.
    
        From version 0.16 to 1.3 HSK project works like one global overhaul mod, which have a short list of compability.
        Now, with this mod, we are working on creating small seperate modules, which changing only they parts of the game.
        We hope, that this new approach will grant us an ability to faster release new versions of mod and make it more compability for all other mods.
